### Project Description:
<p align='justify'>Lumina is an interactive application highlighting “Inverse Light Control”, which emphasizes the opposite behavior between mobile and web interfaces, through the implementation of a light sensor in the mobile app. The light sensor is a non-visible component that gets the current illuminance level around the device in units of lux. By turning the light off in the mobile app, we can activate the light sensor. Once the sensor is activated, whenever there is a change in the light around the device it will automatically execute a block of program that takes the value of illuminance and stores it in the database. The website then makes use of this data to light itself.</p>
